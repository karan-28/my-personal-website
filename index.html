    <h2 id="ques1">What do I plan to do in life?</h2>
    <p>
      As of now I am pretty excited to begin my web development career as an educator. In todayâ€™s technologically driven
      world, I would like to empower the youth of our nation by enhancing their coding skills. I am a keen traveler and
      a cricketer. So managing my professional career along with my hobbies to keep me going is what I plan to do for
      now.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I plan to do this?</h2>
    <p>
      So me along with my team have started this venture called Grofizz. This platform would look to empower kids with
      some skills that would make them stand apart from their peers. We look to diversify this platform to various
      important skills that are currently not catered to that well in our schooling system. One of them is coding ,
      others will be disclosed soon. We have professionals from their respective industry and me along with them would
      try and teach some important skills to children through online sessions.
